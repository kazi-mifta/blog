I started this blog to connect my ideas and share my thoughts with others. For many days, I resisted my self to start the blog. I just procrastinated a lot. Blogging will help me to meet a lot of interesting people I guess. There are tons of other benefits of starting a [blog]. 

Whenever I learned something new, I start to have concepts to express it in an intuitive way that will make it click. I struggled a lot when learning new concepts, but whenever I get to understand it I canâ€™t stop myself to share it. This blog will help me to serve that purpose.

I am a student from Bangladesh. I study Computer Science here. So the majority of the posts will revolve around it. I like to spend my spare time playing football and traveling to new places. But now, blogging will also take some space into it. :)

I am always open to learn and develop myself. I will be glad to receive tons of suggestions.
