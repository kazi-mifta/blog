Hi, I am Kazi from Bangladesh.

I wanted to build stuff with computers from the first day I learned to code. But the knowledge required to build something useful wasn’t in my grasp. The more I learned, the more I realized about the breadth of technologies that are roaming around. Every day something new emerged and I got distracted because of learning it. But I gradually realized that I liked it more than solving random problems. So, I kept on learning and building several projects of my own. I didn’t want to confine myself to a specific stack or something like that. Rather, I want to explore new things. I want to do it by creating new stuff of significance. If the work is important, that inspiration keeps pushing my mind to find a solution. I also like to solve head-banging problems, clever puzzles. I love to play football. This blog will help me to share my journey with others while I am learning cool stuff.
